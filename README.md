## Python Playground

Just some simple CLI scripts for learning Python.

### Number guessing game

This is a simple Python CLI number guessing game.

The script takes user input to check for the number guess.

If the guessed number is not correct, a counter goes up 3 times. If the counter reaches 3, the game exits.

If the user inputs something other than a number, the game exits as well.

### Scrabble scorer

CLI script takes a word, and returns the possible scrabble score.

Does not take into consideration double or triple tiles, it just scores the base score.
